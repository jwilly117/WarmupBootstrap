    <h2>Why do I like this game?</h2>

    <p>Donkey Kong country 3 is a game that gets alot of backlash compared to its two older brothers. I tend to like it because it gets away from the themes of the other two, which I 
        also thoroughly enjoy. When you start off, you are at lake orangatanga where you soon meet funky kong who sends you with Kiddie Kong, who has similiar weight to Donkey, but
        carries the barrel like a sheild similiar to diddy.

    </p>

    <p>Alot of the levels take place in unique environments compared to the normal run of the mill jungle and island levels like the first two. Theres lakesides, saw mills, 
        forest being sawed up by saws, sewers, snowy mountainsides, factories, waterfalls, and of course the ever hated underwater levels.
